# Progress
This week, I bootstrapped the initial application and followed
[a tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-authentication-to-your-app-with-flask-login)
for setting up a basic user authentication system. I modified the example code to add
a phone number field, change the name field to username, and add password and phone validation.

# Plans and Goals for upcoming weeks
- Create a database model for posts
- Add functionality to search posts in that database
